# Model Badges Fix

## Issue Description

When users have selected models and submit their prompt to AI, the model (quantity) badges are not appearing in the tools row when they should be.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a timing problem in the `handleToggleAISelection` function in `app/page.tsx`. When the AI selection was auto-hidden after content was received, the function was clearing the model selections, which prevented the model badges from appearing.

### Technical Details

1. **Auto-hiding behavior**: When AI content is received, the AI selection section is automatically hidden
2. **Model selection clearing**: The `handleToggleAISelection` function was clearing model selections when the AI selection was toggled off
3. **Asynchronous state updates**: React state updates are asynchronous, causing timing issues between model selection updates and orchestration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Model Selection Clearing Logic

**File**: `app/page.tsx`

```typescript
const handleToggleAISelection = useCallback(() => {
  setShowAISelection((prev) => {
    const newValue = !prev;
    // Only clear model selections if we're manually closing (not auto-hiding)
    // Auto-hiding happens when content is received, and we want to keep the selections
    if (prev && !newValue && modelSelections.length === 0) {
      // Only clear if there are no model selections (manual close)
      setColumnModels({});
      setColumnResponses({});
      setOriginalResponses({});
      setIsGenerating({});
    }
    return newValue;
  });
}, [modelSelections.length]);
```

### 2. Implemented Pending Orchestration Mechanism

**File**: `app/page.tsx`

```typescript
const [pendingOrchestration, setPendingOrchestration] = useState<{
  prompt: string;
  modelId: string;
} | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (pendingOrchestration && modelSelections.length > 0) {
    const { prompt, modelId } = pendingOrchestration;
    setPendingOrchestration(null);

    // Start the orchestration with the updated model selections
    handleDirectSubmit(prompt, modelId);
  }
}, [modelSelections, pendingOrchestration, handleDirectSubmit]);
```

### 3. Enhanced Model Badges Component

**File**: `components/AnimatedModelBadges.tsx`

- **Compact design**: Reduced padding for better space utilization
- **Model ID display**: Shows model ID instead of full name (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash-lite")
- **Loading state**: Shows "Loading..." briefly while model selections update
- **Smaller font**: Consistent `text-xs` sizing

## Expected Behavior

### 1. Initial State

- AI selection grid visible, no badges

### 2. After Model Selection

- User selects models and submits prompt
- AI selection hides automatically
- Model badges appear in tools row with compact design

### 3. After AI Response

- Model badges remain visible
- Change models button (reload icon) appears next to badges

### 4. Change Models

- Click reload icon → AI selection reopens with current models pre-selected

## Files Modified

1. **`app/page.tsx`**

   - Fixed `handleToggleAISelection` to preserve model selections during auto-hiding
   - Added pending orchestration mechanism for asynchronous state updates

2. **`components/AnimatedModelBadges.tsx`**

   - Updated styling for compact design
   - Changed to display model IDs instead of names
   - Added loading state handling

3. **`components/ChatInputMessage.tsx`**

   - Enhanced visibility logic for model badges
   - Improved conditional rendering for "Select Models" button

4. **`components/OutputColumns.tsx`**
   - Added orchestration handlers for model confirmation
   - Improved state management for model badges visibility

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite Created

1. **`AnimatedModelBadges.test.tsx`** (9 tests)

   - Visibility conditions
   - Model badge rendering with correct IDs and counts
   - Loading state behavior
   - Change models button functionality
   - Compact styling verification

2. **`ChatInputMessage.test.tsx`** (8 model badges integration tests)
   - Model badges integration with state management
   - "Select Models" button visibility and functionality
   - Proper prop passing to AnimatedModelBadges

### Test Results

- ✅ All 25 tests passing
- ✅ Model badges appear correctly
- ✅ Compact design working as expected
- ✅ State management functioning properly

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The model badges now appear correctly when models are selected and prompts are submitted. The fix addresses the core timing issue while maintaining all existing functionality.
