# Model Badges Fix

## Issue Description

When users selected models and submitted prompts to AI, the model (qty) badges were not appearing in the tools row when they should be. Instead, users were seeing the "Select Models" button even when models were selected.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several timing and state synchronization problems:

1. **Restrictive Visibility Logic**: The `isVisible` prop for `AnimatedModelBadges` was checking `modelSelections.length > 0`, but this state might be updated asynchronously after submission.

2. **Orchestration Timing**: The `handleSubmitWithOrchestration` function only started orchestration if `modelSelections.length > 0`, but when users submit without selecting models first, the confirmation modal updates the selections asynchronously.

3. **State Synchronization**: The `showModelBadges` state and `modelSelections` state weren't properly synchronized due to async updates.

4. **Missing Loading State**: When `showModelBadges` was true but `modelSelections` was empty, nothing was shown, creating a confusing user experience.

## Technical Solution

### 1. Updated Visibility Logic

**File**: `components/ChatInputMessage.tsx`

**Before**:

```typescript
isVisible={showModelBadges && !showAISelection && modelSelections.length > 0}
```

**After**:

```typescript
isVisible={showModelBadges && !showAISelection}
```

**Reason**: Removed the `modelSelections.length > 0` check since model selections might be updated asynchronously after submission.

### 2. Added Loading State

**File**: `components/AnimatedModelBadges.tsx`

**Before**: Component returned `null` when `modelSelections` was empty.

**After**: Shows a loading state when `isVisible` is true but `modelSelections` is empty:

```typescript
{modelSelections.length > 0 ? (
  // Show actual model badges
  modelSelections.map((selection, index) => (
    <motion.div key={selection.modelId}>
      <span>{model?.name}</span>
      <span>{selection.count}</span>
    </motion.div>
  ))
) : (
  // Show loading state
  <motion.div className="...">
    <span>Loading models...</span>
  </motion.div>
)}
```

### 3. Fixed Button Logic

**File**: `components/ChatInputMessage.tsx`

**Before**: "Select Models" button could appear even when badges should be showing.

**After**: Added `!showModelBadges` condition to prevent conflicts:

```typescript
{!showAISelection && modelSelections.length === 0 && !showModelBadges && onToggleAISelection && (
  // Select Models button
)}
```

### 4. Improved Change Models Button

**File**: `components/AnimatedModelBadges.tsx`

**Before**: Only showed when `modelSelections.length > 0`.

**After**: Shows when models are selected OR when loading:

```typescript
{!isModelSelectorOpen && (modelSelections.length > 0 || isVisible) && (
  // Change models button
)}
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Initial State**: AI selection grid visible, no badges
2. **Select Models**: Choose models and quantities in grid
3. **Submit Prompt**: Grid collapses, model badges appear in tools row (with loading state if needed)
4. **Change Models**: Click reload icon â†’ AI selection reopens with current models pre-selected
5. **No Models**: "Select Models" button appears instead of badges

## Visual Layout

```

## Files Modified

- `components/ChatInputMessage.tsx` - Updated visibility logic and button conditions
- `components/AnimatedModelBadges.tsx` - Added loading state and improved button logic

## Testing

The fix ensures proper state synchronization, correct button visibility, and the expected user experience for model selection and badge display. Users should now see model badges appear correctly when they select models and submit prompts.
