# Issues

1. [x] When I load the initial page and the ai model selection section appears, I'm unable to close the window. **FIXED** - Added missing prop connections and fixed rendering logic to prevent duplicate sections.
2. [ ] When I click "New chat" button, the chat input doesn't reset at all times
3. [ ] When I submit where total of all selected ai models qty > 1 and get responses back, the "Remix" button is disabled when it should be enabled
4. [ ] The chat input message container should not have a top border and the background should be transparent
5. [ ] Unable to click the "+" button to attach a file
6. [ ] When i select an ai model and the "Select AI Models" section hides, i don't see the ai model badge in the tools row
