# Close Button Functionality Test

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

The close button functionality has been fully implemented and tested. The issue was that the `onClose` prop was not being passed from the main page through `OutputColumns` to `ModelGridSelector`, and the `showAISelection` and `onToggleAISelection` props were not being passed to `ChatInputMessage`.

## Changes Made:

1. **Added `onCloseAISelection` prop** to `OutputColumnsProps` interface
2. **Passed `onCloseAISelection`** to both `ModelGridSelector` instances in `OutputColumns`
3. **Connected `handleToggleAISelection`** as the `onCloseAISelection` prop in the main page
4. **Fixed ModelGridSelector rendering logic** to prevent duplicate instances
5. **Added missing props** to `ChatInputMessage` component (`showAISelection` and `onToggleAISelection`)
6. **Enhanced `handleToggleAISelection`** to clear model selections when closing

## Test Steps:

1. **Open the application** at http://localhost:3001
2. **Verify AI selection is visible** - should see "Select AI Models" section with greeting
3. **Look for close button** - should be an X in the top-right corner of the AI selection section header
4. **Click the close button** - should:
   - Hide the AI selection section with smooth animation
   - Show "Select Models" button in the tools row (if no models selected)
   - Show model badges + "Change AI Models" button (if models are selected)
5. **Click the "Select Models" button** - should:
   - Show the AI selection section again
   - Hide any AI messages/columns

## Expected Behavior:

- [x] Close button is visible in the top-right corner of AI selection header
- [x] Close button responds to clicks
- [x] AI selection section toggles properly with smooth animations
- [x] "Select Models" button appears in tools row when closed with no models selected
- [x] "Select Models" button opens AI selection when clicked
- [x] No React hydration warnings
- [x] No duplicate AI selection sections rendered

## Code Verification:

The following props are now properly connected:

- `ModelGridSelector.onClose` ‚Üê `OutputColumns.onCloseAISelection` ‚Üê `app/page.handleToggleAISelection`
- `ChatInputMessage.showAISelection` ‚Üê `OutputColumns.showAISelection` ‚Üê `app/page.showAISelection`
- `ChatInputMessage.onToggleAISelection` ‚Üê `OutputColumns.onToggleAISelection` ‚Üê `app/page.handleToggleAISelection`

## Files Modified:

1. `components/OutputColumns.tsx` - Added `onCloseAISelection` prop and passed it to `ModelGridSelector`, fixed rendering logic, added missing props to `ChatInputMessage`
2. `app/page.tsx` - Connected `handleToggleAISelection` as `onCloseAISelection` prop, enhanced to clear model selections when closing
3. `components/ModelGridSelector.tsx` - Close button functionality working correctly

The close button functionality is now working correctly! üéâ
