# Custom Hook Guidelines

This rule outlines the guidelines for creating custom React hooks within this project.

## Custom Hooks

- **Purpose:** Encapsulate reusable stateful logic, especially for data fetching or complex UI interactions.
- **Location:** Place custom hooks in the `hooks` directory at project root.
- **Naming:** Use the `use` prefix (e.g., `useModels.ts`).
- **Data Fetching:** For fetching data from API endpoints.
  - Create dedicated hooks for specific data types
- **Simplicity:** Keep hooks focused on a single responsibility.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a consistent approach to reusable logic and data fetching throughout the application.
