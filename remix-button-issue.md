# RemixButton Model Selection Issue

## Problem

The RemixButton component's model selection dropdown is not working - when a user selects a model, it doesn't persist or display the selected model name.

## Current Behavior

- Dropdown shows "Select Model" even after selection
- localStorage is not being updated with the selected model
- Component re-renders but loses the selected state

## Root Cause

The component is being re-rendered and losing its internal state (`selectedRemixModel`). The localStorage persistence is working (as seen in console logs), but the component state is not being properly maintained across re-renders.

## Evidence

From console logs:

```
üöÄ RemixButton render - variant: initial
üîç Current state: { selectedRemixModel: '', modelsLength: 0, loading: true }
üéØ selectedModelName calculation: { selectedRemixModel: '', modelsLength: 0 }
üéØ No model selected, returning "Select Model"
```

## Files Affected

- `components/RemixButton.tsx` - Main component with state management issue
- `components/OutputColumns.tsx` - Parent component that renders RemixButton

## Status

- ‚úÖ localStorage API calls working
- ‚úÖ Model fetching working
- ‚úÖ Component rendering working
- ‚ùå State persistence across re-renders
- ‚ùå Model selection display

## Technical Details

### Component State

```typescript
const [selectedRemixModel, setSelectedRemixModel] = useState<string>('');
```

### localStorage Key

```typescript
localStorage.setItem('remix-selected-model', modelId);
```

### Model Selection Logic

The component loads models from `/api/chat` and should persist the selected model ID in localStorage, but the state is being reset on re-renders.

## Debug Information

- Component renders correctly with debugging logs
- API calls to fetch models are successful
- localStorage operations are being attempted
- State is being lost between renders

## Next Steps

1. Fix state persistence in RemixButton component
2. Ensure selectedRemixModel state is properly maintained
3. Test model selection functionality
4. Remove debugging logs once fixed

## Related Issues

- Model selection not persisting to localStorage
- Component state reset on parent re-render
- Dropdown not showing selected model name
